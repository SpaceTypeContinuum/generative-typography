# Generative Typography

- Type@Cooper Public Workshop Summer 2020
- 6:30‚Äì9:30pm, 2 sections (Tuesdays & Thursdays), June 2nd to Aug 6th
- Instructors: [Lynne Yun](https://lynneyun.com), [Kevin Yeh](http://kevbk.com)
- Course Discussion: Slack

## Course Description

Since the invention of written language, typography as a practice has existed and adapted to the many forms of human expression ‚Äî from being cast in metal to being manipulated within photographic mediums. Recently, the ability to engage in visual coding through the browser has become easier than ever, opening the doors for creatives to generate and digitally manipulate font structures 
and layouts to create new and exciting compositions.

This class will focus on generative design as it pertains to typography and letterforms. We will explore the building blocks of algorithmic art and apply those tools to manipulate digital type, which is, at its core, a series of data points. In addition to visual coding, the class will engage in critical discussions about the computational nature of creation. How does this differ from historical methods of typographic exploration, and what can we take from the past to build upon it? How do we create generative designs that are meaningful as opposed to frivolous?

P5.js will be the main programming library for the course, and students who are new to programming are welcome. Techniques covered in this course will include building visual compositions with code, manipulating pixel and vector data, and implementing them in real-time applications, such as computer-assisted handwriting and animation.

### Learning Outcomes:
By the successful completion of this course, students will have:

- Comfort in Javascript programming
- Confidence in the P5.js environment
- Critical reasoning as it applies to computational making
- Familiarity with technological advances in typography
- An understanding of digital structures for various data types (images, font files, etc)

## Class Format

In the first half of the workshop, weekly lectures will tie together typographic and programmatic concepts, and browser-based projects will be assigned with specific goals. 

Lots of in-class time will be devoted to working on projects, building programmatic skills, and discussing readings and concepts related to generative typography. You should expect to spend time outside of class gaining additional background and practice with the topics covered by the projects. 

In the latter half, you will apply generative form-making tools as part of your design process in a self-selected medium, such as an interactive website, animated sequence, or dynamic branding identity. We'll hold 1:1 critique sessions to support your creative and technical process.

Throughout the course, we'll be available during class and on slack for all your questions, concerns, and ideas ‚Äî along with your peers.

## General Resources

### Shaders
For image-processing heavy operations like these, using the GPU as opposed to the CPU is a lot faster. You can do this via shaders! The downside is that shaders require a language of their own called GLSL, but is worth tackling if this is in your interest.

* [P5.js Shader Tutorial Series](https://itp-xstory.github.io/p5js-shaders/#/)
* [P5.js Shader example collection on Github](https://github.com/aferriss/p5jsShaderExamples)
* [Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com)

### Accessibility
* If your project is intended for people to interact with, check out [Designing for accessibility is not that hard](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94) by Pablo Stanley. For us, this might mean things like:
	* Adding enough color contrast
	* Adding alt-text if applicable
	* Supporting keyboard navigation
